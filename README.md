# pEHR - Distributed P2P Electronic Health Record System

A peer-to-peer Electronic Health Record system built on Holepunch's Pear Runtime that enables decentralized health data management without central servers.

## Features

- **Decentralized Architecture**: No central servers, operates purely peer-to-peer
- **Multiple Authorship**: Patients, doctors, and hospitals can all contribute to records
- **Multiple Truths**: Each peer can maintain their own filtered view of health data
- **Privacy-First**: End-to-end encryption and local data control
- **Offline Support**: Works without internet connectivity
- **Standards Compliant**: Uses openEHR for structured health records

## Architecture

- **Autobase**: Multi-writer protocol for conflict-free health record collaboration
- **Hyperdrive**: P2P file system for medical images and documents
- **Hyperbee**: Efficient querying of health records using B-tree indexing
- **HyperDHT/Hyperswarm**: Peer discovery and connection management
- **openEHR**: Standardized health record format with archetype-based modeling

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Check system status
npm run cli -- status

# Try interactive mode (recommended)
npm run cli -- interactive

# Run complete demo
node examples/basic-usage.js

# Run tests
npm test
```

## Understanding the Current Implementation

**Important**: The current version uses simplified in-memory storage for demonstration. Each CLI command creates a fresh instance, so data doesn't persist between separate commands. For persistent testing within a session, use:

- **Interactive mode**: `npm run cli -- interactive`
- **Example scripts**: `node examples/basic-usage.js`

See [TESTING-GUIDE.md](docs/TESTING-GUIDE.md) for detailed testing instructions.
