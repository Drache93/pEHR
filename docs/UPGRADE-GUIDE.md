### Development Changes
- All examples continue to work without modification
- Test suite maintains compatibility
- CLI interface unchanged

## Migration Steps

### For Existing Projects
1. Update your `package.json` dependencies:
   ```json
   {
     "dependencies": {
       "autobase": "^7.13.3",
       "autopass": "^2.2.0",
       "corestore": "^7.4.5",
       "hyperbee": "^2.24.2",
       "hypercore": "^11.10.0",
       "hyperswarm": "^4.11.7"
     }
   }
   ```

2. Run the upgrade:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Test the upgrade:
   ```bash
   # Test the P2P functionality
   node examples/ehr-p2p-demo.js
   
   # Try the interactive demo
   node examples/live-demo.js
   ```

### For New Projects
Simply clone and install - all examples work out of the box:
```bash
git clone <repository>
cd pEHR
npm install
node examples/live-demo.js
```

## Performance Improvements

### Autopass 2.2.0 Benefits
- **Better Corestore Integration**: Native support for Corestore 7.x
- **Enhanced Security**: Updated cryptographic libraries
- **Improved Stability**: Better error handling and recovery
- **Performance Optimizations**: Faster peer discovery and data sync

### Hypercore 11.x Benefits
- **Storage Optimizations**: More efficient data structures
- **Network Improvements**: Better connection management
- **Memory Usage**: Reduced memory footprint
- **Compatibility**: Better cross-platform support

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Version Conflicts**: Ensure all Hypercore ecosystem packages are updated together
2. **Node.js Version**: Requires Node.js >= 18.0.0
3. **Native Dependencies**: May need to rebuild native modules after upgrade

### Verification
Run the test suite to verify everything works:
```bash
npm test
node examples/ehr-p2p-demo.js
```

If the P2P demo completes successfully, the upgrade is working correctly.

## Support

If you encounter issues with the upgrade:
1. Check the [troubleshooting section](../README.md#troubleshooting)
2. Verify you're using compatible Node.js version (>= 18.0.0)
3. Try a fresh `npm install`
4. Run the test demos to isolate the issue

## What's Next

With the latest ecosystem in place, the P2P EHR system is ready for:
- Production deployments
- Advanced feature development
- Integration with healthcare systems
- Mobile application development

The upgrade establishes a solid foundation for the next phase of development.
