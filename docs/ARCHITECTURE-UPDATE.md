# pEHR Architecture Update: Autopass Integration

**Date**: January 2025  
**Status**: In Progress  
**Impact**: Major architectural improvement enabling true P2P functionality

## Summary

We are integrating [Autopass](https://github.com/holepunchto/autopass) as the core P2P data layer for pEHR. This solves our Hypercore compatibility issues and provides a battle-tested foundation for patient-controlled, distributed health records.

## Why Autopass?

### Problems It Solves

1. **Hypercore Compatibility**: Autopass uses Corestore 7, avoiding version conflicts
2. **Multi-Writer Support**: Built-in support for collaborative data management
3. **Secure Sharing**: Invite-based pairing perfect for patient-provider relationships
4. **Persistence**: RocksDB backend for reliable data storage
5. **Encryption**: Built-in security features

### Perfect EHR Alignment

- **Patient Control**: Patients own their Autopass instance and control access
- **Healthcare Teams**: Invite-based system matches real healthcare workflows
- **Distributed Storage**: No central server, true P2P architecture
- **File Support**: Native handling of medical images and documents

## New Architecture

### Before (Simplified Demo)
```
EHRCoreSimple
├── In-memory storage
├── No P2P networking
├── No persistence
└── Single instance only
```

### After (True P2P with Autopass)
```
EHRAutopass
├── Autopass (P2P layer)
│   ├── Corestore 7 (storage)
│   ├── RocksDB (persistence)
│   ├── BlindPairing (invites)
│   └── Multi-writer support
├── OpenEHR Validation
├── Healthcare Workflows
└── CLI/UI Interface
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Integration
1. Add Autopass dependency
2. Create EHRAutopass wrapper class
3. Implement basic patient-provider pairing
4. Test cross-terminal P2P functionality

### Phase 2: Healthcare Features
1. openEHR validation layer
2. Patient-controlled access management
3. Healthcare-specific CLI commands
4. Multi-provider team support

### Phase 3: Advanced Capabilities
1. "Multiple truths" via filtered views
2. Web UI for healthcare workers
3. Performance optimization
4. External system integration

## Key Workflows

### Patient Creates EHR
```javascript
const patientEHR = new EHRAutopass('patient-john', './john-ehr')
await patientEHR.initialize()
```

### Patient Invites Provider
```javascript
const invite = await patientEHR.inviteProvider('primary-care')
// Send invite code to Dr. Smith
```

### Provider Joins and Contributes
```javascript
const providerEHR = await EHRAutopass.pair(invite, 'dr-smith', './dr-smith-ehr')
await providerEHR.addMedicalRecord(diagnosisRecord)
// Automatically syncs to patient!
```

### Real-Time Multi-Peer Sync
- Changes made by any provider instantly sync to patient
- Patient can see all records from all providers
- True collaborative healthcare

## Benefits

### For Patients
- ✅ Own and control their health data
- ✅ Selective sharing with providers
- ✅ Data portability between providers
- ✅ Complete medical history in one place

### For Providers
- ✅ Access to complete patient history
- ✅ Real-time collaboration with other providers
- ✅ No central server dependencies
- ✅ Works offline with later sync

### For Healthcare System
- ✅ Reduced data silos
- ✅ Improved care coordination
- ✅ Lower infrastructure costs
- ✅ Enhanced privacy and security

## Migration Path

1. **Current users**: Can continue using simplified demo for testing concepts
2. **New development**: Will use Autopass-based implementation
3. **Backwards compatibility**: Export/import tools for data migration
4. **Gradual rollout**: Test with pilot healthcare teams first

## Technical Details

### Dependencies
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "autopass": "^1.0.0",
    "corestore": "^7.0.0",
    // ... existing dependencies
  }
}
```

### File Structure
```
src/
├── core/
│   ├── ehr-core-simple.js    (kept for demos)
│   ├── ehr-core.js           (original attempt)
│   └── ehr-autopass.js       (NEW: true P2P implementation)
```

## Success Metrics

- ✅ Two terminals can connect as peers
- ✅ Data syncs in real-time between peers
- ✅ Patient controls all access via invites
- ✅ Medical records validated against openEHR
- ✅ Files (images, documents) sync properly
