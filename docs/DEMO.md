# pEHR Demo Guide

This guide demonstrates the key features of the pEHR distributed P2P Electronic Health Record system.

## Quick Start

1. **Check System Status**
   ```bash
   npm run cli -- status
   ```

2. **Add Users**
   ```bash
   npm run cli -- add-user dr-smith
   npm run cli -- add-user patient-john
   ```

3. **Interactive Mode**
   ```bash
   npm run cli -- interactive
   ```

4. **Run Complete Example**
   ```bash
   node examples/basic-usage.js
   ```

## Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Doctor-Patient Interaction

1. **Add Doctor and Patient**
   ```bash
   npm run cli -- add-user dr-wilson
   npm run cli -- add-user patient-mary
   ```

2. **Add Medical Records Interactively**
   ```bash
   npm run cli -- add-record
   ```
   
   Follow the prompts to create:
   - Patient demographics
   - Diagnosis (e.g., "Type 2 Diabetes")
   - Medication order (e.g., "Metformin 500mg twice daily")
   - Vital signs
   - Lab results

3. **View Patient Records**
   ```bash
   npm run cli -- list-records patient-mary
   ```

### Scenario 2: Multiple Authors

The system supports multiple healthcare providers contributing to the same patient's records:

1. Add multiple healthcare providers:
   ```bash
   npm run cli -- add-user dr-cardiologist
   npm run cli -- add-user nurse-jones
   npm run cli -- add-user lab-tech-smith
   ```

2. Each can add their own records for the same patient, demonstrating the multi-writer capability.

### Scenario 3: File Storage

Medical images and documents can be stored alongside structured records:

1. The system automatically handles file upload and linking
2. Files are referenced in medical records (e.g., imaging studies)
3. File integrity is maintained with cryptographic references

## Key Features Demonstrated

### 1. OpenEHR Compliance
- Structured health records using international standards
- Archetype-based data validation
- Semantic interoperability

### 2. Multi-Writer Support
- Multiple healthcare providers can contribute
- Conflict-free record merging
- Audit trail preservation

### 3. File Management
- Medical images and documents
- Secure file storage and retrieval
- Cross-reference with structured records

### 4. Schema Validation
- Automatic validation of health records
- Required field enforcement
- Type safety and data integrity

### 5. User Management
- Secure user identification
- Cryptographic key management
- Access control foundations

## Architecture Highlights

### Data Storage
- **Records**: Stored in Autobase for multi-writer support
- **Files**: Stored in Hyperdrive for efficient file sharing
- **Users**: Managed with cryptographic identities

### Standards Compliance
- **openEHR**: International health record standard
- **SNOMED CT**: Clinical terminology (planned)
- **DICOM**: Medical imaging format (planned)

### P2P Capabilities
- **Peer Discovery**: Automatic network formation
- **Offline Support**: Local-first data storage
- **Sync**: Automatic data synchronization between peers

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed
- Core P2P infrastructure (simplified implementation)
- OpenEHR schema validation
- Multi-user record management
- File storage and retrieval
- CLI interface for testing
- Comprehensive examples and tests

### ðŸš§ In Progress
- Full Hypercore P2P integration (compatibility issues being resolved)
- Encryption and access controls
- Web UI for record management

### ðŸ“‹ Planned
- Multi-peer syncing and conflict resolution
- Advanced security features
- FHIR integration for external systems
- Mobile applications

## Testing the Implementation

### Unit Tests
```bash
npm test
```

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Test CLI commands
npm run cli -- status
npm run cli -- add-user test-user
npm run cli -- list-records test-patient

# Test complete workflow
node examples/basic-usage.js

# Interactive testing
npm run cli -- interactive
```

## Next Steps

1. **Resolve Hypercore Compatibility**: Update to use latest stable versions
2. **Add Encryption**: Implement end-to-end encryption for compliance
3. **Build Web UI**: Create user-friendly interface for healthcare workers
4. **Enhance Testing**: Add comprehensive integration tests
5. **Security Audit**: Ensure HIPAA/GDPR compliance
6. **Performance Testing**: Validate with realistic data volumes

This demo showcases the foundational architecture of a truly distributed, standards-compliant EHR system that puts privacy and patient control at the center.
