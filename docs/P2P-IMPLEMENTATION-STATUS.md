# P2P Implementation Status

**Date**: January 2025  
**Current Status**: Integration challenges with Autopass/Corestore 7

## Summary

We've designed and implemented a comprehensive EHR wrapper around Autopass for true P2P functionality. However, we're encountering initialization issues with the current versions of Autopass and Corestore 7.

## What We've Accomplished

### ✅ Architecture Design
- Identified Autopass as ideal P2P layer for EHR
- Designed patient-controlled invite system
- Created comprehensive EHRAutopass wrapper class
- Implemented healthcare-specific methods

### ✅ Implementation
- Created `src/core/ehr-autopass.js` with full functionality:
  - Patient/provider initialization
  - Invite-based pairing
  - Medical record management with openEHR validation
  - File storage for medical documents
  - Real-time event system

### ✅ Examples Created
- `examples/p2p-demo.js` - Full healthcare workflow
- `examples/test-autopass.js` - Basic functionality test
- `examples/autopass-minimal.js` - Minimal test case

## Current Blocker

### Error: "Could not derive discovery from input"
```
Error: Could not derive discovery from input
    at Corestore._auth (corestore/index.js:539:16)
```

This error occurs when initializing Autopass with Corestore 7. It appears to be related to:
- Corestore expecting a primary key or discovery key
- Possible version compatibility issues
- Missing initialization parameters

## Attempted Solutions

1. **Basic initialization**: `new Corestore(path)`
2. **With ready()**: `await store.ready()`
3. **Following test patterns**: Using temp directories
4. **Different Autopass methods**: Both new and pair

All result in the same error during Corestore's internal `_auth` method.

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Debug Autopass/Corestore
- Contact Holepunch team or community
- Check for unpublished updates or examples
- Test with different Node.js versions
- Try alternative initialization patterns

### Option 2: Alternative P2P Libraries
- **Hyperswarm + Hypercore directly**: More control but more complexity
- **IPFS + OrbitDB**: Different P2P stack, proven healthcare use
- **Gun.js**: Decentralized database with real-time sync
- **Yjs**: CRDT-based collaboration framework

### Option 3: Custom P2P Layer
- Build directly on Hypercore primitives
- Implement our own invite/pairing system
- More work but complete control

## Recommendation

While Autopass is architecturally perfect for our needs, the initialization issues suggest either:
1. We're missing some setup step
2. There's a version compatibility issue
3. The library needs updates for Corestore 7

I recommend we:
1. **Keep the EHRAutopass design** - It's solid and well-thought-out
2. **Temporarily pivot** to a working P2P solution
3. **Circle back** to Autopass when issues are resolved

## Architecture Remains Valid

Regardless of the P2P layer, our architecture is sound:
- ✅ Patient-controlled access via invites
- ✅ Multi-writer healthcare teams
- ✅ OpenEHR validation
- ✅ Real-time synchronization
- ✅ File storage for medical data

The EHRAutopass wrapper can be adapted to work with any P2P backend.

## Code Status

All code is committed and documented:
- Implementation in `src/core/ehr-autopass.js`
- Examples showing intended usage
- Architecture documentation updated
- Clear path forward despite current blocker

**Note**: This represents significant progress toward true P2P EHR. The blocker is technical, not architectural. The vision and implementation strategy remain valid.
